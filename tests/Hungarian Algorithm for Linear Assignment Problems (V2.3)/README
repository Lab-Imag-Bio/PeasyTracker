#  Munkres Assignment Algorithm 
This is an extremely fast implementation of the famous Hungarian algorithm (aslo known as Munkres' algorithm). It can solve a 1000 x 1000 problem in about 20 seconds in a Core Duo (T2500 @ 2.00GHz) XP laptop with Matlab 2008a, which is about 2.5 times faster than the mex code "assignmentoptimal" in FEX ID 6543, about 6 times faster than the author's first version in FEX ID 20328, and at least 30 times faster than other Matlab implementations in the FEX.

The code can also handle rectangular prolems and problems with forbiden allocations.

The new version (V2.3) is able to conduct a partial assignment if a full assignment is not feasible.
